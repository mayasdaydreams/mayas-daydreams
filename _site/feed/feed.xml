		<title>It&#39;s Been a Weird Week</title>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Happy belated Earth Day! It has been a weird week for me, and I feel like since that last time I sat down to do an update a lot of things in my life have already changed again. There are just some periods in life where things move fast I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;personal-updates&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Personal updates &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://mayasdaydreams.com/blog/been-a-weird-week/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One strange thing about being in the climate field that I still haven&#39;t quite gotten a grip on, is that Earth Day, Earth Week, and Earth Month are VERY busy. It&#39;s nice to take a beat to celebrate the planet with folks, but the rest of the work doesn&#39;t stop in the meantime! On top of that, I also found out that I basically need to start looking for a new job... which is depressing, but I&#39;m working through it...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been pouring more and more time into this page, making tiny tweaks, adding little pages that I haven&#39;t created links for yet... There may or may not be a chance to explore a certain shrine that I started in the music section of this post...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only other thing that has been taking up quite a bit of my time &lt;a href=&quot;https://mayasdaydreams.com/blog/I-need-to-declutter/&quot;&gt;decluttering&lt;/a&gt; and unpacking (pun not intended) my relationship with &lt;a href=&quot;https://mayasdaydreams.com/digital-garden/minimalism/&quot;&gt;minimalism&lt;/a&gt;. I have since done some trips to donation centers and little libraries, but I have also been going through my external harddrive. I have taken thousands of photos over the last few years, and these have also been some of the most transformative times of my life. I let go of a lot of photos, which surprised me. A lot of it was junk, photos of receipts or homework, screenshots of stupid tweets or painful conversations. Random stuff like that. But I also ended up going through pictures from trips and letting some of those go too. I am maybe halfway through everything, but I want to do a deeper dive and maybe host some pictures from my favorite trips here, so I&#39;ll come back to this. But going through these decluttering exercises have been really eye opening and cathartic. It feels like a tiny dose of healing, in a weird way. I promise I&#39;ll start blogging about more things than minimalism and decluttering soon, this is just the season of life that I&#39;m in at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;reading-enchantment-by-katherine-may&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Reading: Enchantment by Katherine May &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://mayasdaydreams.com/blog/been-a-weird-week/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This little book is full of so many little gems of wisdon and her writing inspires me to become a better writer. In honor of tonight&#39;s full moon, I will leave a snippet of a passage that I wrote down in my commonplace book:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a child, I would look out of the window on a nighttime drive and think the moon was following us. From my vantage point, she seemed to be chasing us along the sky, breathlessly trying to keep up. Later I learned that it was just because she was so big that it felt like she was everywhere, and that I was small with an outsize sense of my own importance. Still, I was left with the impression that the moon had a certain constancy. It seemed that she was attentive to my needs, concernedly checking in. Sometimes I felt like I needed her gaze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh boy, I am still unpacking this one. Taylor Swift album release nights have become a ritual for me at this point. And I even decided to start building my first &lt;a href=&quot;https://mayasdaydreams.com/shrines/taylorswift/&quot;&gt;shrine&lt;/a&gt; for this site in the hours that I was waiting. It&#39;s definitely a work in progress, but I had so much fun learning more about css to make my own little swiftie corner of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;goals-from-the-beginning-of-the-month&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Goals from the beginning of the month &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://mayasdaydreams.com/blog/been-a-weird-week/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&quot;https://mayasdaydreams.com/blog/april-so-far24/&quot;&gt;first post&lt;/a&gt;, I made a list of goals. I thought it might be fun to revisit these before setting some new goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soak up that eclipse energy &lt;em&gt;I did indeed, and I made some new moon wishes too&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend less money &lt;em&gt;I did indeed, I paid down some debt and owed on my taxes this year, so it doesn&#39;t feel like it... we also booked some travel so we made some big purchases too. But the general random spending on crap habit that I have been trying to kick is improving!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn the numbers in Japanese &lt;em&gt;We&#39;re getting there, I haven&#39;t been practicing as much as I&#39;d like to with how nuts it has been. I have been watching lots of anime lol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a better week at work &lt;em&gt;about that...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do a new moon wishing ritual, and continue to follow the lunar cycle &lt;em&gt;forgot that i made a separate goal for new moon wishes along with enjoying the eclipse! but check! done! had a lovely time!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;goals-for-the-rest-of-the-month&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Goals for the rest of the month &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://mayasdaydreams.com/blog/been-a-weird-week/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Full moon ritual! The fact that I am coming back on the full moon to do a life update is 100% coincidental&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply for 5 jobs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn those stinkin Japanese numbers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start going to the gym again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finish reading a book&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

		<title>My thoughts on minimalism</title>
		<link href="https://mayasdaydreams.com/digital-garden/minimalism/"/>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I talk about minimalism, I am talking about the lifestyle, rather than the aesthetic. To me, it&#39;s a practice of owning only what is essential to you, and letting go of the rest. I also think that while related, minimalism and conscious consumerism are two different things.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>An Observation About Browsing Without The Algorithm</title>
		<link href="https://mayasdaydreams.com/blog/life-without-algoritms/"/>
		<updated>2024-04-14T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://mayasdaydreams.com/blog/life-without-algoritms/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have been off of social media for a few months now. My accounts aren&#39;t completely gone, but I just don&#39;t visit the sites anymore. There was a time that having a presence on social media bothered me, but now it&#39;s just the incessant urge to scroll and keep up with what everyone I have ever had any brief interaction with (including if I just decided to follow them after bingeing Bridgerton). Simply logging off has relieved me of those awful feelings, and I didn&#39;t have to do anything that extreme (to me!!!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if I have been off of social media, I still wanted to be able to enjoy the internet, and casually browse. That bumbling around trying to find a new home on the internet landed me here, for which I am very grateful. I almost forgot what it was like to organically find cool websites, or interesting people&#39;s work to admire. I feel like in a way I found a way to enjoy the internet again without algorithms (or at least minimally!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interesting observation I have made is that I spend more time thinking about whether or not I can trust the people behind the pages I find. Everyone I have come across seems to align in value with me, maybe that&#39;s just an aspect of the indie web, but I do have that moment of pause where I feel like I need to make sure. My hunch is that it&#39;s a reflex against being spoonfed content that is tailored to me, and suddenly being open to anyone&#39;s opinions. It&#39;s a nice feeling, just an observation...&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>I need to declutter.</title>
		<link href="https://mayasdaydreams.com/blog/I-need-to-declutter/"/>
		<updated>2024-04-12T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://mayasdaydreams.com/blog/I-need-to-declutter/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week we found out that we are moving this fall! I am super excited and nervous about it. Wondering if I can keep my job, what kind of place are we going to live in, am I going to like it, will the cat be happy? I think it will go great, plus we&#39;ll be a lot closer to the Sierras! But one thing that&#39;s been nagging me for a long time is the fact that I (and we) just have way too much crap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I definitely went on a retail therapy binge during the darkest times of the pandemic, and it took me a year or so after the worst of it had passed to realize that I didn&#39;t shake the habit. I am now faced with the daunting task of either packing and moving a bunch of stuff that I&#39;m not sure if I even want/need anymore, or just getting rid of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been curious about the idea of &lt;a href=&quot;https://mayasdaydreams.com/digital-garden/minimalism/&quot;&gt;minimalism&lt;/a&gt; for many years, but for whatever reason I haven&#39;t been able to commit to that lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was talking about the anxiety that the mess in my office has been giving me during therapy, and we decided on an action plan. I committed to just trying to spend 15 - 20 minutes a day decluttering. I am hoping that we&#39;ll be more or less ready to move by August. I was curious how much total time would I spend decluttering between now and August 1st, and it came out to 28 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;28-hours&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;28 hours. &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://mayasdaydreams.com/blog/I-need-to-declutter/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I needed one reason to distance myself from stuff, it&#39;s that. That doesn&#39;t even count the trips to donation and reuse centers, or trying to sell or give things away on Facebook, or on those odd days where I feel like decluttering for longer! This also doesn&#39;t count the time it takes to just clean our apartment in general... Is this really how I want to spend my precious time?&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>April So Far</title>
		<link href="https://mayasdaydreams.com/blog/april-so-far24/"/>
		<updated>2024-04-07T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>https://mayasdaydreams.com/blog/april-so-far24/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One week into April and I feel so much better than I did in March. Is March hard for other people, or am I just jinxing myself every year into having a bad month. Nevertheless, here&#39;s a little recap of my first week of April&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;personal-updates&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Personal updates &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://mayasdaydreams.com/blog/april-so-far24/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work was super intense this week. By the end of the week I felt that good-old freeze response kick in as the sound of Teams chats and emails made me want to cry. It started with preparing for a stressful meeting where I proposed a project to my boss, then a public meeting that went a little sideways, too much work that I can fit into 8 hours, and a couple of passive aggressive emails from a coworker (as expected).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was also a week of great news too! My husband got into grad school!! Which we have been anxiously waiting to hear back about since last December. I am very proud of him and excited for our move. Thankfully we aren&#39;t moving far, and I should be able to keep my job! We both started to feel a little bit of anxiety now that reality is setting in and we&#39;ve got to start planning for a pretty big life change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also started learning Japanese this week! I feel like I already have a good amount of the hiragana alphabet down, and I was able to recognize a few vocab words in the Tokyo Vice dialog, which was exciting! I can&#39;t help but notice that people don&#39;t say &amp;quot;thank you&amp;quot; very much in that show, lol. We are hoping to do a trip to Japan this summer, which I am very excited to start planning for in earnest!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting time into this blog this weekend was such a nice escape from all that work stress. Especially because the nastiest email came in at around 4:45. It always feels so bad when you put a ton of work in all week, but there&#39;s always that one thing that you didn&#39;t get to. It just wasn&#39;t a priority for me this week, and I communicated that! Ugh, I&#39;m ranting about work again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like I should be thankful that work is always busy for me around this time of year, because the reason makes me feel a little proud. It&#39;s Earth Month! We joke on my team that every day is Earth Day for us because we manage a lot of climate adaptation projects at my workplace. Between organizing activities, giving talks, and keeping up with my daily work, it just turns into a bit of a flurry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am so excited about this blog though! It&#39;s only two days old and already feels like home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;reading-the-garden-of-seven-twilights-by-miguel-de-palol&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Reading: The Garden of Seven Twilights by Miguel de Palol &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://mayasdaydreams.com/blog/april-so-far24/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Garden of Seven Twilights is such a cool book! I actually started it over this week because I got sidetracked and forgot what was happening. I picked it up in a bookstore in Ann Arbor when we visited for Thanksgiving last year. I was just drawn to the thickness of it and the semi-post-apocalyptic setting. I&#39;ll be sure to update as I get further in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;listening-the-new-beyonce-duh&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Listening: The New Beyonce, duh! &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://mayasdaydreams.com/blog/april-so-far24/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am loving Cowboy Carter! My favorite song is bodyguard!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;goals-for-this-week&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Goals for this week &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://mayasdaydreams.com/blog/april-so-far24/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soak up that eclipse energy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend less money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn the numbers in Japanese&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a better week at work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do a new moon wishing ritual, and continue to follow the lunar cycle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
