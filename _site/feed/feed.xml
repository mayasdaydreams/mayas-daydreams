		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last week we found out that we are moving this fall! I am super excited and nervous about it. Wondering if I can keep my job, what kind of place are we going to live in, am I going to like it, will the cat be happy? I think it will go great, plus we&#39;ll be a lot closer to the Sierras! But one thing that&#39;s been nagging me for a long time is the fact that I (and we) just have way too much crap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I definitely went on a retail therapy binge during the darkest times of the pandemic, and it took me a year or so after the worst of it had passed to realize that I didn&#39;t shake the habit. I am now faced with the daunting task of either packing and moving a bunch of stuff that I&#39;m not sure if I even want/need anymore, or just getting rid of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been curious about the idea of minimalism for many years, but for whatever reason I haven&#39;t been able to commit to that lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was talking about the anxiety that the mess in my office has been giving me during therapy, and we decided on an action plan. I committed to just trying to spend 15 - 20 minutes a day decluttering. I am hoping that we&#39;ll be more or less ready to move by August. I was curious how much total time would I spend decluttering between now and August 1st, and it came out to 28 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;28-hours&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;28 hours. &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://mayasdaydreams.com/blog/I%20need%20to%20declutter./&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I needed one reason to distance myself from stuff, it&#39;s that. That doesn&#39;t even count the trips to donation and reuse centers, or trying to sell or give things away on Facebook, or on those odd days where I feel like decluttering for longer! This also doesn&#39;t count the time it takes to just clean our apartment in general... Is this really how I want to spend my precious time?&lt;/p&gt;

April 7th, 2024&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One week into April and I feel so much better than I did in March. Is March hard for other people, or am I just jinxing myself every year into having a bad month. Nevertheless, here&#39;s a little recap of my first week of April&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;personal-updates&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Personal updates &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://mayasdaydreams.com/blog/april-so-far24/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work was super intense this week. By the end of the week I felt that good-old freeze response kick in as the sound of Teams chats and emails made me want to cry. It started with preparing for a stressful meeting where I proposed a project to my boss, then a public meeting that went a little sideways, too much work that I can fit into 8 hours, and a couple of passive aggressive emails from a coworker (as expected).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was also a week of great news too! My husband got into grad school!! Which we have been anxiously waiting to hear back about since last December. I am very proud of him and excited for our move. Thankfully we aren&#39;t moving far, and I should be able to keep my job! We both started to feel a little bit of anxiety now that reality is setting in and we&#39;ve got to start planning for a pretty big life change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also started learning Japanese this week! I feel like I already have a good amount of the hiragana alphabet down, and I was able to recognize a few vocab words in the Tokyo Vice dialog, which was exciting! I can&#39;t help but notice that people don&#39;t say &amp;quot;thank you&amp;quot; very much in that show, lol. We are hoping to do a trip to Japan this summer, which I am very excited to start planning for in earnest!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting time into this blog this weekend was such a nice escape from all that work stress. Especially because the nastiest email came in at around 4:45. It always feels so bad when you put a ton of work in all week, but there&#39;s always that one thing that you didn&#39;t get to. It just wasn&#39;t a priority for me this week, and I communicated that! Ugh, I&#39;m ranting about work again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like I should be thankful that work is always busy for me around this time of year, because the reason makes me feel a little proud. It&#39;s Earth Month! We joke on my team that every day is Earth Day for us because we manage a lot of climate adaptation projects at my workplace. Between organizing activities, giving talks, and keeping up with my daily work, it just turns into a bit of a flurry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am so excited about this blog though! It&#39;s only two days old and already feels like home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;reading-the-garden-of-seven-twilights-by-miguel-de-palol&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Reading: The Garden of Seven Twilights by Miguel de Palol &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://mayasdaydreams.com/blog/april-so-far24/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Garden of Seven Twilights is such a cool book! I actually started it over this week because I got sidetracked and forgot what was happening. I picked it up in a bookstore in Ann Arbor when we visited for Thanksgiving last year. I was just drawn to the thickness of it and the semi-post-apocalyptic setting. I&#39;ll be sure to update as I get further in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;listening-the-new-beyonce-duh&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Listening: The New Beyonce, duh! &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://mayasdaydreams.com/blog/april-so-far24/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am loving Cowboy Carter! My favorite song is bodyguard!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;goals-for-this-week&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Goals for this week &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;https://mayasdaydreams.com/blog/april-so-far24/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soak up that eclipse energy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Spend less money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn the numbers in Japanese&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have a better week at work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do a new moon wishing ritual, and continue to follow the lunar cycle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
