In the meantime, picture a big little lies cut scene\"></p>\n<p>Running is one of my great loves. I'm not very good at it, and it's taken me a long time to be okay with that. I think that one of the big journeys that I have been on since turning 30 is learning to enjoy things in spite of being bad at most of my hobbies. I am not sure exactly where this idea came from, but it always felt like things weren't worth doing if I couldn't do it perfectly. Yes, I am a recovering perfectionist. Last weekend I participated in the Big Sur Marathon... not the full marathon... the 12k.</p>\n<p>I have been dreaming of doing the <em>actual</em> for many, many years. It's still a dream!! I even signed up for the full marathon twice and injured myself... twice. Both of those failures really crushed me. My relationship with running and myself were in a dark place for a while. All of the miles, hours of running, and running essays I read were worth nothing because I didn't make it to the start line.</p>\n<p>The Big Sur Marathon is... special. It's really not a good choice for people who are looking to run their first marathon. Although this year was not the usual course because a portion of Highway 1 washed out in a storm. It is also either one of the, or THE hilliest marathon in the country. Those heights pay off though because you're running along one of the most iconic roadways in the world. And because it's on Highway 1, which means they need to close the highway for race day means that there's a pretty strict time limit of 6 hours. There's something about the combination of the scenery, the physical challenge, and that ever present threat that the highway will one day completely fall into the ocean makes me really want to experience the full 26.2 mile distance on foot.</p>\n<p>Now that I know where I'm at with my running better now, I think that I could maybe make it to 6 hours on a perfectly flat course. Realizing I was going to fail this race not once, but twice really felt like I died trying. To my credit, I recovered and kept running, I set more realistic goals, and am keeping the marathon on my bucket list. I actually ran my first half marathon in March! So I would say that I'm well on my way to making it to the start line again. I had the time of my life this weekend running along the highway for a bit and then through Point Lobos Reserve was a dream. Gorgeous. I went into Sunday just wanting to have a good time.</p>\n<p>I'm a little bit weirdly obsessed with this race, but it turns out that I'm not alone in that. I feel like I got a taste of the experience that I was craving. The only sounds at one point were my footsteps and the waves hitting the rocks down below. It was beautiful and I felt strong. I had a plan for when I would eat my little snack, I knew exactly when I wanted to take a walking break. Much to my amazing luck that was also the point where the big 12k photo op was, so my pictures make it look like I just went on a nice seaside stroll, looking for mermaids.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>All of May 2024, I will be participating in weblog posting month created by Annie Greens (look up actual username)</p>\n<p>For a list of other participants, go here</p>\n<p>For a list of my topic ideas and some rules I wrote for myself, go here</p>\n<p>Post 1/31</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>Happy belated Earth Day! It has been a weird week for me, and I feel like since that last time I sat down to do an update a lot of things in my life have already changed again. There are just some periods in life where things move fast I guess.</p>\n<h2 id=\"personal-updates\" tabindex=\"-1\">Personal updates <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://mayasdaydreams.com/blog/been-a-weird-week/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>One strange thing about being in the climate field that I still haven't quite gotten a grip on, is that Earth Day, Earth Week, and Earth Month are VERY busy. It's nice to take a beat to celebrate the planet with folks, but the rest of the work doesn't stop in the meantime! On top of that, I also found out that I basically need to start looking for a new job... which is depressing, but I'm working through it...</p>\n<p>I have been pouring more and more time into this page, making tiny tweaks, adding little pages that I haven't created links for yet... There may or may not be a chance to explore a certain shrine that I started in the music section of this post...</p>\n<p>The only other thing that has been taking up quite a bit of my time <a href=\"https://mayasdaydreams.com/blog/I-need-to-declutter/\">decluttering</a> and unpacking (pun not intended) my relationship with <a href=\"https://mayasdaydreams.com/digital-garden/minimalism/\">minimalism</a>. I have since done some trips to donation centers and little libraries, but I have also been going through my external harddrive. I have taken thousands of photos over the last few years, and these have also been some of the most transformative times of my life. I let go of a lot of photos, which surprised me. A lot of it was junk, photos of receipts or homework, screenshots of stupid tweets or painful conversations. Random stuff like that. But I also ended up going through pictures from trips and letting some of those go too. I am maybe halfway through everything, but I want to do a deeper dive and maybe host some pictures from my favorite trips here, so I'll come back to this. But going through these decluttering exercises have been really eye opening and cathartic. It feels like a tiny dose of healing, in a weird way. I promise I'll start blogging about more things than minimalism and decluttering soon, this is just the season of life that I'm in at the moment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reading-enchantment-by-katherine-may\" tabindex=\"-1\">Reading: Enchantment by Katherine May <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://mayasdaydreams.com/blog/been-a-weird-week/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>This little book is full of so many little gems of wisdon and her writing inspires me to become a better writer. In honor of tonight's full moon, I will leave a snippet of a passage that I wrote down in my commonplace book:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As a child, I would look out of the window on a nighttime drive and think the moon was following us. From my vantage point, she seemed to be chasing us along the sky, breathlessly trying to keep up. Later I learned that it was just because she was so big that it felt like she was everywhere, and that I was small with an outsize sense of my own importance. Still, I was left with the impression that the moon had a certain constancy. It seemed that she was attentive to my needs, concernedly checking in. Sometimes I felt like I needed her gaze.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"listening-the-tortured-poets-department\" tabindex=\"-1\">Listening: The Tortured Poets Department <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://mayasdaydreams.com/blog/been-a-weird-week/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Oh boy, I am still unpacking this one. Taylor Swift album release nights have become a ritual for me at this point. And I even decided to start building my first <a href=\"https://mayasdaydreams.com/shrines/taylorswift/\">shrine</a> for this site in the hours that I was waiting. It's definitely a work in progress, but I had so much fun learning more about css to make my own little swiftie corner of the internet.</p>\n<h2 id=\"goals-from-the-beginning-of-the-month\" tabindex=\"-1\">Goals from the beginning of the month <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://mayasdaydreams.com/blog/been-a-weird-week/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>In my <a href=\"https://mayasdaydreams.com/blog/april-so-far24/\">first post</a>, I made a list of goals. I thought it might be fun to revisit these before setting some new goals.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Soak up that eclipse energy <em>I did indeed, and I made some new moon wishes too</em></li>\n<li>Spend less money <em>I did indeed, I paid down some debt and owed on my taxes this year, so it doesn't feel like it... we also booked some travel so we made some big purchases too. But the general random spending on crap habit that I have been trying to kick is improving!</em></li>\n<li>Learn the numbers in Japanese <em>We're getting there, I haven't been practicing as much as I'd like to with how nuts it has been. I have been watching lots of anime lol</em></li>\n<li>Have a better week at work <em>about that...</em></li>\n<li>Do a new moon wishing ritual, and continue to follow the lunar cycle <em>forgot that i made a separate goal for new moon wishes along with enjoying the eclipse! but check! done! had a lovely time!</em></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"goals-for-the-rest-of-the-month\" tabindex=\"-1\">Goals for the rest of the month <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://mayasdaydreams.com/blog/been-a-weird-week/\">#</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Full moon ritual! The fact that I am coming back on the full moon to do a life update is 100% coincidental</li>\n<li>Apply for 5 jobs</li>\n<li>Learn those stinkin Japanese numbers</li>\n<li>Start going to the gym again</li>\n<li>Finish reading a book</li>\n</ul>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>I have been off of social media for a few months now. My accounts aren't completely gone, but I just don't visit the sites anymore. There was a time that having a presence on social media bothered me, but now it's just the incessant urge to scroll and keep up with what everyone I have ever had any brief interaction with (including if I just decided to follow them after bingeing Bridgerton). Simply logging off has relieved me of those awful feelings, and I didn't have to do anything that extreme (to me!!!).</p>\n<p>Even if I have been off of social media, I still wanted to be able to enjoy the internet, and casually browse. That bumbling around trying to find a new home on the internet landed me here, for which I am very grateful. I almost forgot what it was like to organically find cool websites, or interesting people's work to admire. I feel like in a way I found a way to enjoy the internet again without algorithms (or at least minimally!).</p>\n<p>One interesting observation I have made is that I spend more time thinking about whether or not I can trust the people behind the pages I find. Everyone I have come across seems to align in value with me, maybe that's just an aspect of the indie web, but I do have that moment of pause where I feel like I need to make sure. My hunch is that it's a reflex against being spoonfed content that is tailored to me, and suddenly being open to anyone's opinions. It's a nice feeling, just an observation...</p>\n",

Wondering if I can keep my job, what kind of place are we going to live in, am I going to like it, will the cat be happy? I think it will go great, plus we'll be a lot closer to the Sierras! But one thing that's been nagging me for a long time is the fact that I (and we) just have way too much crap.</p>\n<p>I definitely went on a retail therapy binge during the darkest times of the pandemic, and it took me a year or so after the worst of it had passed to realize that I didn't shake the habit. I am now faced with the daunting task of either packing and moving a bunch of stuff that I'm not sure if I even want/need anymore, or just getting rid of it.</p>\n<p>I have been curious about the idea of <a href=\"https://mayasdaydreams.com/digital-garden/minimalism/\">minimalism</a> for many years, but for whatever reason I haven't been able to commit to that lifestyle.</p>\n<p>I was talking about the anxiety that the mess in my office has been giving me during therapy, and we decided on an action plan. I committed to just trying to spend 15 - 20 minutes a day decluttering. I am hoping that we'll be more or less ready to move by August.

By the end of the week I felt that good-old freeze response kick in as the sound of Teams chats and emails made me want to cry. It started with preparing for a stressful meeting where I proposed a project to my boss, then a public meeting that went a little sideways, too much work that I can fit into 8 hours, and a couple of passive aggressive emails from a coworker (as expected).</p>\n<p>This was also a week of great news too! My husband got into grad school!! Which we have been anxiously waiting to hear back about since last December. I am very proud of him and excited for our move. Thankfully we aren't moving far, and I should be able to keep my job! We both started to feel a little bit of anxiety now that reality is setting in and we've got to start planning for a pretty big life change.</p>\n<p>I also started learning Japanese this week! I feel like I already have a good amount of the hiragana alphabet down, and I was able to recognize a few vocab words in the Tokyo Vice dialog, which was exciting! I can't help but notice that people don't say &quot;thank you&quot; very much in that show, lol. We are hoping to do a trip to Japan this summer, which I am very excited to start planning for in earnest!</p>\n<p>Putting time into this blog this weekend was such a nice escape from all that work stress. Especially because the nastiest email came in at around 4:45. It always feels so bad when you put a ton of work in all week, but there's always that one thing that you didn't get to. It just wasn't a priority for me this week, and I communicated that! Ugh, I'm ranting about work again!</p>\n<p>I feel like I should be thankful that work is always busy for me around this time of year, because the reason makes me feel a little proud. It's Earth Month! We joke on my team that every day is Earth Day for us because we manage a lot of climate adaptation projects at my workplace. Between organizing activities, giving talks, and keeping up with my daily work, it just turns into a bit of a flurry.</p>\n<p>I am so excited about this blog though! It's only two days old and already feels like home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reading-the-garden-of-seven-twilights-by-miguel-de-palol\" tabindex=\"-1\">Reading: The Garden of Seven Twilights by Miguel de Palol <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://mayasdaydreams.com/blog/april-so-far24/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The Garden of Seven Twilights is such a cool book! I actually started it over this week because I got sidetracked and forgot what was happening. I picked it up in a bookstore in Ann Arbor when we visited for Thanksgiving last year. I was just drawn to the thickness of it and the semi-post-apocalyptic setting. I'll be sure to update as I get further in!</p>\n<h2 id=\"listening-the-new-beyonce-duh\" tabindex=\"-1\">Listening: The New Beyonce, duh! <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://mayasdaydreams.com/blog/april-so-far24/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I am loving Cowboy Carter!
