			"content_html": "<p>Last week we found out that we are moving this fall! I am super excited and nervous about it. Wondering if I can keep my job, what kind of place are we going to live in, am I going to like it, will the cat be happy? I think it will go great, plus we'll be a lot closer to the Sierras! But one thing that's been nagging me for a long time is the fact that I (and we) just have way too much crap.</p>\n<p>I definitely went on a retail therapy binge during the darkest times of the pandemic, and it took me a year or so after the worst of it had passed to realize that I didn't shake the habit. I am now faced with the daunting task of either packing and moving a bunch of stuff that I'm not sure if I even want/need anymore, or just getting rid of it.</p>\n<p>I have been curious about the idea of minimalism for many years, but for whatever reason I haven't been able to commit to that lifestyle.</p>\n<p>I was talking about the anxiety that the mess in my office has been giving me during therapy, and we decided on an action plan. I committed to just trying to spend 15 - 20 minutes a day decluttering. I am hoping that we'll be more or less ready to move by August. I was curious how much total time would I spend decluttering between now and August 1st, and it came out to 28 hours.</p>\n<h3 id=\"28-hours\" tabindex=\"-1\">28 hours. <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://mayasdaydreams.com/blog/I%20need%20to%20declutter./\">#</a></h3>\n<p>If I needed one reason to distance myself from stuff, it's that. That doesn't even count the trips to donation and reuse centers, or trying to sell or give things away on Facebook, or on those odd days where I feel like decluttering for longer! This also doesn't count the time it takes to just clean our apartment in general... Is this really how I want to spend my precious time?</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>April 2024 So Far\nApril 7th, 2024</p>\n<p>One week into April and I feel so much better than I did in March. Is March hard for other people, or am I just jinxing myself every year into having a bad month. Nevertheless, here's a little recap of my first week of April</p>\n<h2 id=\"personal-updates\" tabindex=\"-1\">Personal updates <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://mayasdaydreams.com/blog/april-so-far24/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>Work was super intense this week. By the end of the week I felt that good-old freeze response kick in as the sound of Teams chats and emails made me want to cry. It started with preparing for a stressful meeting where I proposed a project to my boss, then a public meeting that went a little sideways, too much work that I can fit into 8 hours, and a couple of passive aggressive emails from a coworker (as expected).</p>\n<p>This was also a week of great news too! My husband got into grad school!! Which we have been anxiously waiting to hear back about since last December. I am very proud of him and excited for our move. Thankfully we aren't moving far, and I should be able to keep my job! We both started to feel a little bit of anxiety now that reality is setting in and we've got to start planning for a pretty big life change.</p>\n<p>I also started learning Japanese this week! I feel like I already have a good amount of the hiragana alphabet down, and I was able to recognize a few vocab words in the Tokyo Vice dialog, which was exciting! I can't help but notice that people don't say &quot;thank you&quot; very much in that show, lol. We are hoping to do a trip to Japan this summer, which I am very excited to start planning for in earnest!</p>\n<p>Putting time into this blog this weekend was such a nice escape from all that work stress. Especially because the nastiest email came in at around 4:45. It always feels so bad when you put a ton of work in all week, but there's always that one thing that you didn't get to. It just wasn't a priority for me this week, and I communicated that! Ugh, I'm ranting about work again!</p>\n<p>I feel like I should be thankful that work is always busy for me around this time of year, because the reason makes me feel a little proud. It's Earth Month! We joke on my team that every day is Earth Day for us because we manage a lot of climate adaptation projects at my workplace. Between organizing activities, giving talks, and keeping up with my daily work, it just turns into a bit of a flurry.</p>\n<p>I am so excited about this blog though! It's only two days old and already feels like home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reading-the-garden-of-seven-twilights-by-miguel-de-palol\" tabindex=\"-1\">Reading: The Garden of Seven Twilights by Miguel de Palol <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://mayasdaydreams.com/blog/april-so-far24/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>The Garden of Seven Twilights is such a cool book! I actually started it over this week because I got sidetracked and forgot what was happening. I picked it up in a bookstore in Ann Arbor when we visited for Thanksgiving last year. I was just drawn to the thickness of it and the semi-post-apocalyptic setting. I'll be sure to update as I get further in!</p>\n<h2 id=\"listening-the-new-beyonce-duh\" tabindex=\"-1\">Listening: The New Beyonce, duh! <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://mayasdaydreams.com/blog/april-so-far24/\">#</a></h2>\n<p>I am loving Cowboy Carter! My favorite song is bodyguard!</p>\n<h2 id=\"goals-for-this-week\" tabindex=\"-1\">Goals for this week <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://mayasdaydreams.com/blog/april-so-far24/\">#</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Soak up that eclipse energy</li>\n<li>Spend less money</li>\n<li>Learn the numbers in Japanese</li>\n<li>Have a better week at work</li>\n<li>Do a new moon wishing ritual, and continue to follow the lunar cycle</li>\n</ul>\n",
