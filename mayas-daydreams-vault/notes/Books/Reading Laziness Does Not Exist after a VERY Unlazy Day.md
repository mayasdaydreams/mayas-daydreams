"...our lazy feelings are protective and instructive..."

Laziness as a feeling that we should learn to trust <3 

i definitely wasn't lazy today, but some days i am. i think that my lazy days make it possible for me to have those ultra productive days when i need them. it's unsustainable to think that i can have a day like to today.

i also sometimes need to remember that i can take sick days if i need to. it's funny because tomorrow i am sort of doing a half day. i *am* going to the doctor, but i usually feel so emotionally drained after that i need a lie down. is that lazy? is that a misuse of sick time? i don't think so!

"fighting depression is a full-time job"

"The evils of procrastination could easily be avoided if only the procrastinator would just work a little harder in advance-- or at least that's what people tend to think. In reality procrastination is a much more complex beast, one that's often caused by caring a whole lot and wanting to do well."
