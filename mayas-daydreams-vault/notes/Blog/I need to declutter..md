Last week we found out that we are moving this fall! I am super excited and nervous about it. Wondering if I can keep my job, what kind of place are we going to live in, am I going to like it, will the cat be happy? I think it will go great, plus we'll be a lot closer to the Sierras! But one thing that's been nagging me for a long time is the fact that I (and we) just have way too much crap.

I definitely went on a retail therapy binge during the darkest times of the pandemic, and it took me a year or so after the worst of it had passed to realize that I didn't shake the habit. I am now faced with the daunting task of either packing and moving a bunch of stuff that I'm not sure if I even want/need anymore, or just getting rid of it.

I have been curious about the idea of minimalism for many years, but for whatever reason I haven't been able to commit to that lifestyle. 

I was talking about the anxiety that the mess in my office has been giving me during therapy, and we decided on an action plan. I committed to just trying to spend 15 - 20 minutes a day decluttering. I am hoping that we'll be more or less ready to move by August. I was curious how much total time would I spend decluttering between now and August 1st, and it came out to 28 hours.

### 28 hours.

If I needed one reason to distance myself from stuff, it's that. That doesn't even count the trips to donation and reuse centers, or trying to sell or give things away on Facebook, or on those odd days where I feel like decluttering for longer! This also doesn't count the time it takes to just clean our apartment in general... Is this really how I want to spend my precious time?
