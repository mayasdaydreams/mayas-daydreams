This website is called maya's daydreams, but what are my daydreams? there are so many things! in honor of the new moon, let's make some wishes. At least the ones I feel comfortable sharing online!

I would love to finish my first novel. My great monster romance...

I want to start a youtube channel. I have actually been recording little faceless day in the life footage on my phone for a few weeks now. all i need to do is collect enough footage... and then write a script.

I want to live more minimally and frugally. I want it to be second nature to have less and live with less.

I want to get as close to a zero waste lifestyle as I possibly can

I want to get out of student loan debt

I want to run a marathon

I want to run in the Boston Marathon

I want to retire some day

I want a dog

I want to get a month ahead on my family's living expenses

I want a side hustle that I enjoy

I want to lose weight... just a little bit of weight

I want to learn to love cooking

I want to FINALLY pass the FE exam

I want to sew a garment that I can wear on a daily basis

I want to knit a sweater

I want to knit a pair of socks

I want a promotion

I want to travel somewhere every year

I want to hike the Appalachian Trail
