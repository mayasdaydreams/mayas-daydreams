I callled in sick to my job today because of my period. I did attend a few meetings and handled a fraction of the avalanche of emails that are stressing me out, but for some reason I feel like it was dishonest to call in sick. I did not realize that my hormones would become such a reoccurring topic on my blog, but here we are with another period post. 

I did not sleep all night because I was uncomfortable (not in horrible pain, which I was happy to notice), I was dealing with mild cramps this morning. And today, because I trying not to cry my eyes out because my husband is leaving for a two and a half week trip to see his extended family in Europe. (Don't comment on my commas I'm trying to take advice from Ursula Le Guin). I also spent most of last night and today feeling like I was cleaning up a crime scene every hour. So I called in sick.

I worked a little. Washed my pajamas (again), worked a little bit, watched Bridgerton, went for a walk (because my middle school gym teacher said it would help), picked up snacks on the way home, took a shower, and watched more Bridgerton. It feels like I took a day off and lied by using sick time. But I did feel sick. And I did the things that I knew would make me feel better just like if I had the flu.

- For the flu: i prescribe robitussin, lots of blankets, soup, and netflix
- For day 2 of your period: i prescribe trying to do something at your day job, calling in sick, making your cat be a hot water bottle, getting out your actual hot water bottle, sharing your hot water bottle. light exercise (gym teacher said so), snacks (i said so), and watching your favorite show. And also, deal with the debilitating pain, weird emotions, and constant gross feeling. 
- For saying goodbye to your spouse for two and half weeks, I prescribe spending as much time with them as you can before they leave.

Yeah, I called in sick today, and I really do feel like it was necessary.
