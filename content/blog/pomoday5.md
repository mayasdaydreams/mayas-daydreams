Here is the to-do list that i set up in this blog... once I figured out how to post... Let's revist my list... which I am realizing that I totally coded in a weird way... and let's also make a new list

  <h4>Website To-Do List</h4>
  <p> <s> ❑ Figure out how to edit stylesheet </s> <em> completed 4/13/24 </em> </p>
  <p> <s> ❑ Grid on homepage? </s> <em> completed 4/13/24 </em> </p>
  <p> <s> ❑ Figure out how to edit the home page (lol) </s> <em> completed 4/13/24 </em> </p>
  <p> <s> ❑ Figure out how to add pages </s><em> completed 4/13/24 </em>  </p>
  <p> <s> ❑ Add a now page </s> <em> completed 4/13/24 </em> </p>
  <p> ❑ Turn this list into a page / add changelog <em> have not started! </em>  </p>
  <p> ❑ Figure out how to set up webmentions <em> still working on </em>  </p>
  <p> ❑ Start planting digital garden seeds <em> started, but this will never be done </em>  </p>
  <p> ❑ Link to neocities <a href="https://da-greenhouse.neocities.org/">greenhouse </a></p>
  <p> ❑ Join a webring? <em> done </em>  </p>

Looking back, I am honestly impressed with how far I got! There was quite the learning curve with learning how to launch a static website, but I feel really accomplished! Even if my page is kind of clunky... Here's an  updated to-do list for future me to work on. I am mainly focusing on posting month this month, but these are the ones that have been bugging me while i click around...

#### Website To Do List
- Add a changelog
- Figure out webmentions
- neocities page build-out
- find a new heading font for my website
- figure out how to add images to blog posts
- update the general fonts on my website
- more shrines!
- add a resources page (with a free notion template, my other love!)
