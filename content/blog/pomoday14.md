My first week experimenting with the johnny.decimal system and following the steps in the workbook has been really interesting! I have been trying my best to refrain from categorizing my stickies and just let them all sit there, but halfway into my tuesday, i decided to just make an inbox section, a work section, and a not work section. anything that pops into my head, things i need to do, places i want to be able to find things, where i usually keep stuff, random thoughts. so far there are three different sticky notes about minotaurs...
