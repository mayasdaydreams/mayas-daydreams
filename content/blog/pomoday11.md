So, I decided to start over on my CSS stylesheet for my page... just to see what happens. I have learned so much in the last month, that I am trying to see how far I can get by hand-ish. Here's a little screencapture of how far I got today. I also added a changelog to the homepage!!

I also just realized that the link is broken to go to my <a href="/blog/weblogpomo2024">original list of post ideas</a> on all of the posts before this. I'll go back and fix it on the rest of the posts after the month is over. I'm a little bit scared that all of my edits will be spammed to Mastodon. I have also been lazy about hyperlinking and referencing things thus far, so that's another retrospective change that I'll make at the end of the month.

I am a big fan of the idea of digital gardens, and I would love to all of these posts and pages to be seen as living documents that eventually, you'll be able to click around at your leisure. In the meantime, I'm still trying to learn how websites work and finding my blogging style, so I hope you're all liking the chaos that has been coming from this page all this month.

I hope you're all enjoying your saturdays!
