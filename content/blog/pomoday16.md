### What a Week
I had an intense week this week. Big presentation, big deadlines, big conversations, socialized this week, and I got my period for the first time in years. I was not prepared. I think I might have lost my therapist? I’m not sure, I’m confused. This was such a hard week, that I couldn’t really do anything about it. I missed my post for yesterday, and I’m okay with that. Something had to give.

I think the combination of all of the above put me in a bit of a shopping relapse. Nothing too bad, but I feel a little sad. I mostly bought digital things, which is a little weird.

### Biggest win
Stuck up for myself at work!

### Recent Favorites
I have been loving Shogun. I pretty much ripped through all of Bridgerton Season 3 Part 1 in one sitting. We are rewatching Better Call Saul as well.

I haven’t been reading much outside of productivity books. I am on a bit of a life overhaul kick.

### Weekend Project Ideas
I think I’m happy with the content (for now) on my front page. So, I think my next project will be to edit the blog front page a little bit. I want to organize my novel a little bit. I am also thinking about going for a little bit of a train run!
