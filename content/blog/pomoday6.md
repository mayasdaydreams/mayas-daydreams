Another short post today. I have been home alone all weekend and my husband came home from visiting his sister today! I spent a big chunk of my planned writing time making a dish called Marry Me Chicken. It turned out really good, I can't really tell you anything about any wedding results. I also found a job opening that I need to apply for tonight. So excuse my short post today. I hope you all had a nice Monday!
