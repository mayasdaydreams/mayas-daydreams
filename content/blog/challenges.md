It has been a minute since I last posted! In that time Weblog Posting Month left, June started, I went to Michigan for a funeral, did some online shopping, started a new decluttering challenge (I'm almost done!), and am getting ready to embark on my next one. I will now take a few minutes to reflect on all of these and talk a little bit about what's next. I also want to at some point make some updates to my website's design (if you can call it that, lol) this month. I won't really be mentioning that in the rest of this post, but that's my update!

## Weblog Posting Month... Did I Fail?
I was tempted to call WeBlogPoMo a failure, but I won't do that to myself. I did not post every day. Which bummed me out. Basically as soon as I started to fizzle out and lose my motivation as a whole.
