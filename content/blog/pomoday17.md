Today I went for a run in lake chabot. It ended up being about 8.6 miles with 900 feet of elevation gain. The first half was very difficult, pretty much up hill the whole way. Maybe the last two or three miles went back to being flat. I had an amazing time, it has been two years since I did that run.
